<!-- Brief Description -->

## Brief Description
We have created an app that allows a user to create a job, track that job in the lien process, and submit the job info to an administrator when they are ready to submit a Notice of Intent, Lien, or Release of Lien.

## How to Use
When a user logs in, they are brought to a homepage where they can add a job, check for Notice of Intent eligible jobs, check their lien filed jobs & release eligible jobs. Within the listed jobs, if they are in the correct time period, they can click a button to submit a request to an administrator to file their documents legally. Users can also check out their profile to see what their information is in the system.

Users can also create an account if they don't already have one.

Admin can log in and see all jobs all user's input, and see where they are in the lien process. They can get more details on a job and click a button to change where the job is in in the lien process if the admin has completed their paperwork for it.

## Background Information
